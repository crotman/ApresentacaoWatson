    abstract = "{Background: Treatment selection requires review of patient (pt) and clinical features, medical literature, national guidelines, physician experience, and cost-value issues. The IBM Watson for Oncology with Cota RWE (WfO/Cota) point-of-care decision support tool ingests pt attributes from electronic health records and displays treatment recommendations (TRx) based on Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center training and medical literature. The system has been recently supplemented with real world data curated by Cota listing historical treatments and survival outcomes drawn from the treating physicianâ€™s institution and a national database. WfO/Cota is undergoing testing at John Theurer Cancer Center (JTCC, Hackensack, NJ, USA). Concordance of WfO/Cota with expert opinions is required to confirm that cognitive computing TRx match best practices.}",
